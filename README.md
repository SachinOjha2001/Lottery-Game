# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

'''

🧩 Key Features

🎰 Random Number Generator using React state

🧠 Conditional Rendering to show win/lose messages

⚛️ Component-based Structure for clean and reusable UI elements

🔄 Real-time UI Updates using the useState hook

💡 Beginner-friendly logic with a polished UI

🔧 Tech Stack

React.js

JavaScript (ES6+)

CSS for styling

Vite / Create-React-App (whichever you used)

📝 How It Works

User clicks the “Try Your Luck” button

A random number is generated and displayed

If the number meets the winning condition, a success message appears

Otherwise, the game encourages the user to try again

🎮 Purpose of the Project

This project helped me practice:

Using React hooks

Managing component state

Writing clean and modular UI components

Implementing logic-based UI rendering

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (or [oxc](https://oxc.rs) when used in [rolldown-vite](https://vite.dev/guide/rolldown)) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
